# Globetrot — Visa Platform Proposal

This repository hosts a static proposal site outlining the Globetrot no-code visa platform. The page presents the full MVP scope across Softr pages, Airtable schema, automation scenarios, compliance considerations, delivery timeline, and fixed-price quotes.

## Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the interactive document. Region, country, and visa type selectors demonstrate the guided experience travellers will see inside the Softr build.

## Highlights

- User and admin journeys mapped end-to-end, including portals and email touchpoints.
- Airtable data model, dynamic forms, Make/Zapier scenarios, and payment flows documented.
- Pricing tiers, analytics & security checklist, acceptance criteria, and four-week timeline.
- Fixed-price quotes for the core MVP and the multilingual + appointment picker add-ons.

## Customization

Update copy, pricing, or automation details directly within `index.html`. Styling rules live in `styles.css`, and lightweight JavaScript helpers power the navigation and visa selector inside `script.js`.
